├── css/
│   └── styles.css      # Main stylesheet
├── js/
│   └── script.js       # JavaScript functionality
├── images/             # Image assets (placeholder directory)

```

## Getting Started

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Customization

### Images

For a complete website, you'll need to add real images to the `images/` directory:

- `hero-bg.jpg` - Hero background image (recommended size: 1920×1080px)
- `barber-portrait.jpg` - Portrait of the barber (recommended size: 600×800px)
- Gallery images (recommended size: 600×600px)

### Colors

The color scheme can be easily modified by changing the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #a67c52;
    --secondary-color: #2c2c2c;
    /* other variables */
}
```
