IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING IMAGES

The images are not appearing because you need to add actual image files to this directory.
The website is looking for the following image files:

1. hero-bg.jpg - This is the background image for the hero section
   - This should be a high-quality landscape image of your barbershop or a barber scene
   - Recommended size: 1920 x 1080 pixels

2. barber-portrait.jpg - This is the image of the barber for the About section
   - This should be a professional photo of you or the barber
   - Recommended size: 600 x 800 pixels

3. Gallery images - For the gallery section
   - Create 6 images named gallery-1.jpg, gallery-2.jpg, etc.
   - These should be photos of haircuts you've done
   - Recommended size: 600 x 600 pixels

HOW TO ADD IMAGES:
1. Find the images you want to use
2. Rename them to match the names above (hero-bg.jpg, barber-portrait.jpg, etc.)
3. Copy them to this "images" folder
4. Replace any existing placeholder files

Once you've added these image files, they will automatically appear on your website.

NOTE: If you see a "broken image" icon on the website, it means the image file is missing
or has the wrong name. Make sure the file names exactly match what's listed above.
